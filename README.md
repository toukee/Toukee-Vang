SOC Analyst Technical Troubleshooter Cybersecurity Learner

I’m building my career in cybersecurity with a foundation in technical troubleshooting, safety‑driven operations, and clear, structured communication. My background in mechanical and technical environments taught me how to diagnose issues methodically, document findings, and work with precision — strengths I now apply to security investigations and SOC workflows.

On my GitHub, I share the projects, labs, and investigations I’m using to grow into an L1 SOC role. Everything here reflects real progress and hands‑on learning.

What I’m Working On
- SOC‑style investigations and incident write‑ups
- Windows Defender, Sysmon, and event log analysis
- Splunk fundamentals and detection logic practice
- Documentation templates for cybersecurity reporting
- Continuous learning through labs, research, and community resources

Education
- Bachelor of Applied Management and Leadership
- Ongoing self‑study in cybersecurity, threat analysis, and SOC operations
